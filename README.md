# Uninitialized State Variable Access in React Native

This repository demonstrates a common error in React Native development: accessing a state variable before it's initialized. This leads to unexpected behavior, often resulting in `undefined` values or crashes.

## Problem

The `Bug.js` file showcases the problem.  Accessing `this.state.count` in the `render` method before the component mounts and the state is properly set results in `undefined`. 

## Solution

The solution in `BugSolution.js` uses conditional rendering or a default value to handle the case where the state variable is not yet initialized. This prevents unexpected behavior.

## How to reproduce:

1. Clone the repository.
2. Run `npm install`.
3. Run the app in your preferred React Native environment.
4. Observe the initial render behavior of both `Bug.js` and `BugSolution.js` to see the error and solution in action.
